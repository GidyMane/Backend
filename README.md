# Green Bean

## Project Description
Green bean is a web application designed to offer a sports booking and events service that provides clear information on venues such as hockey rinks, basketball courts, and other sports recreational centres. This web app would further allow athletes, coaches, event planners, and others to search or rent arenas around the GTA based on their needs and user rated feedback.

## Motivation
Our team identified a problem in the sports facility booking space and how many of these sports booking platforms lacked proper social integration features. We examined other competitors in the same field and observed that other apps did not contain crucial features such as community feedback about each facility in order to provide insight into the quality of the rented facilities. We aimed to develop an application which not only streamlines the process of booking sports venues whether for both recreational and competitive games, but also integrates social features that foster community engagement and build connections among users. In addition, our app includes an event planning services feature that enables planners to coordinate and organise events for users, reducing their burden and ensuring a smoother experience. We believe that our app should be accessible to the general public, meeting the needs of all users, while providing the best experience possible.

## Installation
The software you need to have installed on your machine to run our code is VSCode. Our main foundation in our project will be centered around HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js and Firebase. Node.js will be our runtime environment while Express.js is used to structure the development of the project. Everything will be developed through VSCode.

## Contribution
We are using git flow, and we have the following branches: 

* main (or master): This branch contains production-ready code. It always reflects the most stable version of the project.

* develop: This branch contains the latest code that is ready to be merged into main after thorough testing. It's the integration branch for new features.
* Feature Branches: Feature/feature-name
* Release Branches: release/release-version
* Hotfix Branches: hotfix/hotfix-name

Furthermore, we are going to be using jira for a ticketing system, and we will be using pull requests before merging anything to the dev/main.
